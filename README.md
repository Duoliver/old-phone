# Old Phone [WIP]

An attempt to recreate a mobile phone from the early-2000s using ReactJS.

The project is under construction and with a modest array of features planned.

## How is it going?

By the time this readme is being written, we have a basic cellphone model (which will be reshaped), a keyboard with numbers and actions that can interact with the screen. The only two "pages" we have are the first one, the homescreen, and another one where the user can type numbers.
